# LiveSplit-Spelunky-HD

This autosplitter was initially created by sashavol but the source was lost. This repo is the decompiled code from dotpeek with some updates to make it compile again.

Some sources I used while looking into learning how LiveSplit components work:

* https://gist.github.com/TheSoundDefense/cf85fd68ae582faa5f1cc95f18bba4ec
* https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/blob/master/README.md#common-compiling-issues
